            <p>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Lightly spray a 9-inch springform pan with cooking spray.
                <br>Wrap outside of the pan in a double layer of heavy-duty aluminum foil, making sure to reach all the way up
                the sides
                of the pan.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Prepare the Crust: Stir together graham cracker crumbs, melted butter, granulated sugar,
                <br>and salt in a bowl until
                thoroughly combined. <br>Press mixture onto the bottom of the prepared springform pan.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Bake in the preheated oven until set and lightly golden, about 15 minutes.<br>
                Transfer to a wire rack and let cool for 20 minutes.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
